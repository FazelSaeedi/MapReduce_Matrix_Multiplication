Multiplication of 2 Matrix (parallel)


There are  input file witch it represent matrix A & B  


pay attention to early initialize (e.g -> dimentions of Matrixs)
  First set dimention of Matrix into its variable
  
  
just run main.py file to start


and then you will able to see Output in Console
